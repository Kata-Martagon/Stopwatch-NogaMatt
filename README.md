# Orbital Stopwatch

## What?
A gravitational physics model with particles orbiting a centre star representing the passing of time.
Particles are coloured based on the fraction of time they represent.
- blue: hundredths, 
- green: tenths,
- yellow: seconds,
- purple; minutes

## Why?
Initially conceived as TDD project that was finished ahead of schedule.
A canvas and physics model experiment

## How?
Using canvas and an object based gravity model.
Parameters can easily be altered to represent different states.

## Limitations
This model doesn't take advantage of parallel processing through WebGL so the browser can be quickly overwhelmed.
